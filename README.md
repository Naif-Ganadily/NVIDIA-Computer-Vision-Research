# NVIDIA Computer Vision Research

## Overview

This repository showcases my contributions to a computer vision research project at NVIDIA, conducted under the mentorship of Professor Stan Birchfield and Dr. Jonathan Tremblay from July 2023 to March 2024. The project focused on enhancing object recognition and scene understanding through the use of synthetic and real-world data.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Handling Datasets
- Managed the YCB dataset, consisting of 21 objects, ensuring it was well-prepared for analysis and processing.

### 2. 3D Modeling and Rendering
- Utilized Blender to import objects and apply accurate textures, creating synthetic images that closely match real-world spatial coordinates for consistency.

### 3. Image Processing
- Extracted vertex information from both static and dynamic renders, capturing data from synthetic images as well as real RGB footage.

### 4. Data Analysis
- Conducted comparative analysis of vertex data between synthetic and real images to support research in object recognition and scene understanding.

### 5. Dataset Compilation
- Assembled a dataset comprising 48 grids that showcase objects in various orientations, contributing to the development of more robust computer vision models.
