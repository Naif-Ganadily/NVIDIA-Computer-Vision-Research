I used Blender Python Script to automate the extraction of pixel coordinates of visible vertices of an object from a 3D scene in Blender across a sequence of frames and save the data to a JSON file. I also provided visual video demonstrations of the pixels being displayed on each object.

At present, I've observed a consistent offset of 32 pixels. The discrepancy might stem from the difference in coordinate origin between Blender and OpenCV conventions or another underlying cause. Nevertheless, this issue has been resolved
